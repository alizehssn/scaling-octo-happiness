This application was created in order to easily find consumer products that met the dietary and
allergen restrictions set by the user. Upon opening the application, there is a navigation bar at
the top of the page in order to search for makeup, food, or recipes. <img src="assets/images/nav.png" width="500px">
When the user clicks on their respective search criteria, they are taken to the respective
page of their request.

If the user selects ‚Äúfood products‚Äù from the navigation they are shown a search bar in which
they can enter a product brand. When the product is entered, the application pulls information
from [Spoonacular Api](https://spoonacular.com/food-api) and returns multiple products that match the search description.

When the user selects ‚ÄúRecipes‚Äù from the search navigation, they are given 3 ways to search for recipes.  Search by ingredients,search by nutrients and to search randomly. When search by ingredients is picked, a simple input box is displayed with a drop down menu to select 1,5 or 10 recipes to search for. <br><img src="assets/images/recipe1.png" width="400px"><br>

All recipes have a ‚ô• next to the recipe image.  Clicking the ‚ô• will store the recipe and all information on the saved recipe tab.  When this tab is visited, each recipe that is saved has 3 buttons, recipe instructions, equiptment needed for the recipe and a button the remove the recipe from the saved page.  All of the information on this page will save into local storage so if the user closes the app and revisits it the next day, all their recipes will be saved!<br>
