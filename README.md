This application was created in order to easily find consumer products that met the dietary and
allergen restrictions set by the user. Upon opening the application, there is a navigation bar at
the top of the page in order to search for makeup, food, or recipes. *insert description of index
page*. When the user clicks on their respective search criteria, they are taken to the respective
page of their request.

If the user selects “food products” from the navigation they are shown a search bar in which
they can enter a product brand. When the product is entered, the application pulls information
from [Spoonacular Api](https://spoonacular.com/food-api) and returns a product profile displaying the name, brand, allergen info,
and ingredients of the product.

If the user selects “Recipes” from the search navigation
If the user selects “Makeup” from the search navigation, the user is taken to the Makeup
Investigation page. The user can then select which dietary, allergen, or ethical criteria to find
makeup products from. The user then is shown drop-down menus with options to search by
product or brand. The user can then select between 5 and 15 results to pull. When the search
button is clicked, the application queries the Heroku-Makeup API and returns products from a
variety of brands ,or from one brand depending on the user’s criteria, that meet their needs.
